It is a \"pure\" abstract math topic, but can be applied to real-world situations where there is error and uncertainty.\n","\n","The main reason we need statistics is because it is generally not possible to collect *all* the data ever for a problem. Doing that is called a census (what the US tries to do every 10 years), and is generally expensive and unrealistic (especially if data changes over time). Instead for most problems we have data about a subset of it - a *sample* - and then we use statistics to say things about the broader *population* (all data) that it represents.\n","\n","There are two types of methods in statistics - *descriptive* and *inferential*. Descriptive means summarizing data, often with measures such as the mean, median, and mode. Inferential means identifying patterns in your sample data and making predictions about the broader population.\n","\n","For today we'll be starting with descriptive statistics - inference is clearly cool, but a lot of good work can be done by starting simple and only making things more complicated as necessary."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vHOQ5ok2k6rn","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Random Variables\n","\n","In most math, a variable is a symbol to specify an arbitrary, but still in some sense unchanging and unique, value.

You've already seen this! A (fair) die provides a uniform distribution across its outcomes. All this means is that all the outcomes are *equally likely*, or \"equiprobable.\"\n","\n","The uniform distribution is somewhat special because it can be both discrete (die-roll) and continuous (interval). `random.random()` that we used above is an example of a continuous uniform distribution.\n","\n","What real-world data is uniform (besides dice and random number generators)?\n","\n","- A raffle for a TV sells 500 tickets to 500 different people, and then draws one at random to pick a winner. This is an example of a discrete random uniform distribution (essentially like rolling a really large die).\n","- You are at a bus stop where the bus comes by once per hour, but you do not know when it last came through. The time you have to wait is a (continuous) uniform random distribution over $[0, 1]$ hours.\n","- 317 baseball players are all ranked based on their ability, from 1 (the best) to 317 (the worst). One is then selected at random - the rank corresponding to whoever was selected is distributed according to a discrete random uniform distribution over `[1, 2, 3, ..., 315, 316, 317]`."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HhVL-rMdgsGH","colab_type":"code","outputId":"9a9c5e34-1a4d-4a47-a2d0-a0acb47b9bb1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1559859980320,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":590,"user":{"displayName":"Sriram Sharma","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AfbL7gI_6qI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALc/scHzC35QFTc/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"16330861996061951163"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["# Exercise!
