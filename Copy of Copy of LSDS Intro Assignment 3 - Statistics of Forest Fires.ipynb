In this assignment you'll look at a data set of forest fires in Portugal during 2007 - this is a real research dataset, and you can [read more about it](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires) though you do not need to for this assignment.\n","\n","For our purposes, the main thing that you need to understand are the attributes in the data.\n","\n","1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9\n","2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9\n","3. month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'\n","4. day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'\n","5. FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code) - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20 \n","6. DMC (Duff Moisture Code)- DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3\n","7. DC  (Drought Code) -  DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6\n","8. ISI (Initial Spread Index ) - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10\n","9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30\n","10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100\n","11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40\n","12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4\n","13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 \n","\n","Most of these features are numeric - this means we can do things like look at their mean, median, mode, and plot histograms. They have technical sounding names, but generally refer to meteorological data (i.e. the weather).\n","\n","For the discrete features we can still draw histograms (as in the lecture notebook). X and Y are already integer values - month and day do have natural order, but if you want to use them you may want to translate them from strings to numbers (hint - you can build a dict that maps them, and loop over to apply it)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2hdt1i4H6gQ2","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Exercise 1 - Load the data and take a peek\n","\n","The data is

This is related to the Monte Carlo method used to demonstrate the central limit theorem. In this setting, such simulations could then be applied to Bayesian methods - another topic for another time.\n","\n","For the same three variables that you looked at in exercise 2, you should do the following:\n","\n","1. Generate a *new* variable based on taking values at random from the original one - make the new variable have at least 10 times as many observations as the original\n","2. Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the new variable (it's okay to use prewritten functions for this)\n","3. Compare your results to what you saw in exercise 2 - it should be very similar\n","\n","Once you're done, look back at your code. Chances are you learned things as you wrote it, and you can revisit it to clean it up a bit. Maybe put pieces of code you use multiple times in a function, or add some explanatory comments so anyone reading (including \"future you\") has a clearer understanding of what you did."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yExZ2S4W-xDG","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":170},"outputId":"dc11fb66-8d73-40a2-bc67-3ade3114261c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1559860958542,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":325,"user":{"displayName":"Sriram Sharma","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AfbL7gI_6qI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALc/scHzC35QFTc/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"16330861996061951163"}}},"source":["import random\n","ffmc_random_draws = df['FFMC'].sample(n=50000, random_state=1, replace=True)\n","#print(ffmc_random_draws)\n","\n","ffmc_random_draws.describe()\n","\n","\n","\n","#random.sample(ffmc_cache, 6000) \n","#print (ffmc_random_draws)\n","\n","# Your code here!\n","# You'll definitely want to import random\n","# And you may find random.choice particularly helpful\n","\n","#The mean for FFMC is 90.6446808510636\n","#the median for FFMC is 91.6\n","\n"],"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["count    50000.000000\n","mean        90.641828\n","std          5.490931\n","min         18.700000\n","25%         90.200000\n","50%         91.600000\n","75%         92.900000\n","max         96.200000\n","Name: FFMC, dtype: float64"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-XLJzhUk9Nro","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"965f2ac6-dd99-4706-dc84-ddafd8222516","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1559860965492,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":351,"user":{"displayName":"Sriram Sharma","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AfbL7gI_6qI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALc/scHzC35QFTc/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"16330861996061951163"}}},"source":["ffmc_random_draws.median()"],"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["91.6"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sj5RYe9yBlfh","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Exercise 4 (*Optional* \"stretch goal\") - Simulate a *lot* of data\n","\n","For *one* of the variables you've been looking at:\n","\n","1.
