Cleaning Missing Values\n","\n","Why do we care if there are missing values? Well, some predictive models will break if there is any missing data in the dataset. So how are we going to deal with this?\n","\n","Our options are basically: \n","\n","**1) Fill in the missing data with something sensible**\n","\n","or \n","\n","**2) Get rid of the missing data** - It's not missing if it doesn't exist. :)\n","\n","If you'll recall the embarked and embark_town features (columns) only had two missing values. If we were to fill these in even with completely arbitrary values it wouldn't damage the predictive power of our data very much. What pandas functions can we use to fill in NA values?\n","\n","GOOGLE IT AGAIN!\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ent7bikWd-9j","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## .fillna() - Data Imputation\n","\n","the [.fillna()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html) function can help us fill NA (NaN) values with different measures of center like the mean, or median of a column (if the column is numeric). Or we can use a \"forward-fill\" or \"backwards-fill\" technique to simply force missing cells to have the same value as the closest before/after cell that contains an actual value. \n","\n","At this step in the process we probably won't be able to go back in time and obtain the true data, the best that we can do is to try and fill in the missing values using a process that will hopefully be better than random.\n","\n","Lets use a forward-fill technique on the embarked and embarked_town columns to address the two missing values
