Cleaning Missing Values\n","\n","Why do we care if there are missing values? Well, some predictive models will break if there is any missing data in the dataset. So how are we going to deal with this?\n","\n","Our options are basically: \n","\n","**1) Fill in the missing data with something sensible**\n","\n","or \n","\n","**2) Get rid of the missing data** - It's not missing if it doesn't exist. :)\n","\n","If you'll recall the embarked and embark_town features (columns) only had two missing values.
